    "- **moduleName:** A short name given to this instance of the G2 engine (i.e. your G2Module object)\n",
    "- **iniParams:** A JSON document containing system parameters (see the section called \"Initialization Parameters\")\n",
    "- **iniFilename:** A fully qualified path to the G2 engine INI file (often /opt/senzing/g2/python/G2Module.ini)\n",
    "- **verboseLogging:** A boolean which enables diagnostic logging - this will print a massive amount of information to stdout (default = False)\n",
    "- **configID:** (optional in version-1 functions) The identifier value for the engine configuration can be returned here. (Note: as C does not accept optional parameters, C users should call the `initAndGetConfigID()` function to initialize the Senzing engine and return the engine's configuration ID)\n",
